**Project Statement:**

Football is a very popular game worldwide. It was invented in England in the nineteenth century and  is now played by more than 240 million people according to International Federation of Association Football. 

Also known as soccer in some countries, the motivation for this project is inspired from an opportunity to work with a large database of football data. This data was provided by BBC , ESPN, and several other sport new channel through web scraping. 

Two main datasets were used. The first dataset was chosen because it has the highest level of detail and the lowest levels of missing values and erroneous data. The second dataset includes all matches played in six European countries, including Portugal, for 5 years spanning from 2012 to 2017. 

Another example would be Soccer Match Outcome/Goals Prediction based on their style of play.

We will also be covering the analysis/ questions like below using the best classifier to compare through the performance matrix and make predictions:-

1.   Which players are the best finishers?
2.   Analyzing Goals Scored?
3.   Analyzing Substitutions?
4.   Analyzing Yellow/Red Cards?
5.   Analyzing Penalties?
6.   Which players have the most “expected goals”?
7.   Which players are the worst at deciding their shots?
8.   Which players make the best/most dangerous passes?
